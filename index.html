      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I am a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School. 
        I've made this website because I am require to by the Stuy Spectator Web Department.
        I don't have much else to say here, other than that I'm excited to be part of the team and
        as you can probably tell already, I had a lot of fun making this website.
